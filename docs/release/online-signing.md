# Online stable release guide

Run `scripts/release/ceremony.sh --help` to inspect the supported commands.
This command needs no key, changes no GitHub state, and does not start a release.

The implementation combines SOPS-style keyless signatures and provenance with
OpenBao-style review of a draft before publication. No SOPS or OpenBao service
is installed. GitHub's short-lived OIDC identity signs routine releases; the
existing recovery key authorizes that delegation once.

**1.0 is paused for design work.** Merge and validate this implementation first.
The checked-in bootstrap currently contains no approved stable release. None of
the setup or release commands below have been run as part of implementation.

## One-time setup

1. Use a clean checkout of merged `main`. Install the pinned tools listed in
   `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Go, Cosign, GitHub CLI, jq and Git with
   cryptographic signing enabled. Authenticate `gh` as the release maintainer.
   The repository must retain protected main, immutable version tags and
   immutable public releases. Publication checks immutable-release settings,
   signed tags and exact-commit CI; the build probes tag immutability. These
   checks do not silently change repository controls.
2. Confirm the existing encrypted recovery key and its passphrase are
   recoverable. The default signer is
   `~/Library/Application Support/hikyo/nightly-bootstrap/tools/key-custody`.
   It retrieves the existing Keychain passphrase without printing it. A custom
   `HIKYO_RECOVERY_SIGNER` must implement
   `sign recovery-1 INPUT OUTPUT_BUNDLE`, using the existing recovery key and
   keyed Cosign bundle format. Never put a passphrase in a command argument.
3. Run `scripts/release/ceremony.sh setup`. Inspect the displayed public policy
   before typing its exact authorization phrase. It binds the repository and
   owner numeric IDs, stable workflow, tag namespace, hosted runner, OIDC
   issuer, Fulcio/Rekor roots, SCT requirement, existing primary inventory,
   nightly policy and bridge inventory. The helper recovery-signs the proposal,
   verifies it, and opens a signed, DCO-signed-off public trust PR.
4. Review and merge that PR after green CI. Pull main and run
   `scripts/release/ceremony.sh status`. Success means the stable workflow
   delegation authenticates; it is not evidence of a published stable release.

Activation adds only `stable-policy.json`, `stable-policy.sigstore.json` and
`stable-trusted-root.json` under `release/trust/`. It preserves the deployed
root, nightly policy, bridges and historical release authorization. Ordinary
builds refuse to run until this delegation authenticates.

## Routine releases

Use the actual approved version in place of `VERSION`, without a leading `v`.
Do not run `build 1.0.0` until designs and final-candidate acceptance are done.

1. **Build the draft:** from clean current main, run
   `scripts/release/ceremony.sh build VERSION`. The helper requires green CI
   for the exact commit and synchronized published trust. Review the commit
   and confirm the signed tag push. The release workflow builds and signs a
   complete draft, including image/chart signatures and provenance. Wait for
   `release-build` to succeed. A draft is not official publication.
2. **Review:** run `scripts/release/ceremony.sh review VERSION`. It downloads the
   complete draft, verifies signatures, identity, closed inventory, provenance,
   rollback state and actual OCI signatures, and prints the local directory
   and manifest SHA-256. Inspect release notes, acceptance evidence and source
   changes. Keep that exact hash.
3. **Publish:** run
   `scripts/release/ceremony.sh publish VERSION REVIEWED_MANIFEST_SHA256`.
   The helper downloads and verifies again, rejects a changed hash, and asks
   for confirmation of the exact version and hash. The local publication helper
   from clean current main checks the tag, CI, draft, OCI subjects and asset
   inventory immediately before publishing. It uses your existing administrator
   `gh` login to read immutable-release settings; GitHub's standard workflow
   token cannot read that administration endpoint. It requires immutable
   releases, then redownloads and verifies the public result. Wait for the
   command to pass.
4. **Record published trust:** run
   `scripts/release/ceremony.sh sync-trust VERSION`. It re-verifies the public
   release and opens a PR containing its signed metadata and catalog. Review
   and merge after green CI, then pull main. The next build refuses to start
   until this synchronization is complete.

There is one human review/publication boundary. With one maintainer it does not
provide independent two-person approval. GitHub account security, protected
workflow changes and careful source review remain part of release security.

## Verification and retries

Public downloads and proposals are retained under
`~/Library/Application Support/hikyo/stable-releases`, overridable with
`HIKYO_RELEASE_STATE_DIR`. These contain public evidence only. Rollback state
is separate from per-version download directories at
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/Library/Application Support}/hikyo/release-trust.json`,
overridable with `HIKYO_RELEASE_TRUST_STATE`; do not delete it to make an old
release pass. The verifier's `--state PATH` option selects an explicit persistent
file.

`review` may be repeated for the same authenticated bytes, including before the
trust-update PR merges. `publish` may be retried after a network interruption:
an already public immutable release is verified against the reviewed hash
without modifying it. A differing manifest, changed assets, invalid identity,
revocation or rollback is a failure, not permission to regenerate evidence.

Setup and trust-sync PR retries reuse matching verified trust proposals and
existing PRs. Divergent branch content is refused for manual inspection. Do
not force-push or reset a release branch to bypass that refusal.

An outstanding stable draft blocks a second candidate, preventing two routine
builds from reusing the same release sequence. Publish and synchronize the
existing draft before starting another version.

An existing version tag is never recreated. If a build fails before all OCI
and draft assets exist, inspect the original run. Rerunning may fail closed
where versioned OCI subjects already exist. If the original byte set cannot
be completed safely, use a new version. Publication never rebuilds artifacts.

Old binaries without stable-workflow policy support cannot validate this new
profile. Update the verifier/runtime through an already authenticated path;
never treat a signature failure as permission to disable verification. The
new verifier retains explicit historical keyed verification and current
revocation checks.

Homebrew remains a downstream convenience channel. After public verification,
run `scripts/release/ceremony.sh homebrew VERSION`, confirm the proposed tap
PR, and review its protected PR separately. The online ceremony does not automatically merge the tap PR.

## Custody and recovery

The existing root was generated on an online Mac, with encrypted local Cosign
keys and separate Keychain passphrases. Do not describe it as an offline or
hardware-isolated root. Routine release signing no longer decrypts either
long-lived key. The primary key remains relevant to historical trust; the
recovery key still authorizes policy changes and revocation.

Vaultwarden can hold an encrypted recovery-key attachment and the recovery
information. Putting ciphertext and its passphrase in the same vault accepts
that a compromise of the unlocked vault can expose both. This is the selected
convenience tradeoff, not independent custody. There is no USB requirement.

Keep an independent encrypted backup outside the same Vaultwarden instance and
failure domain. Include attachment files as well as a consistent database
backup, configuration and the information needed to decrypt and restore it.
Do not make recovering the only vault backup depend on a password stored only
inside that unavailable vault. Test restore and a harmless sign/verify drill
annually and after changing custody. This implementation has not inspected or
changed the running Vaultwarden instance or its backups.

For a compromised GitHub account or workflow, first stop release authority and
revoke affected GitHub credentials. Audit source, workflow changes, tags and
published subjects. Use recovery-authorized policy revocation for affected
manifest hashes; do not assume keyless signing makes malicious releases safe.
Policy changes require an explicitly reviewed recovery-signed update, not
another ordinary release signature. A root change remains an out-of-band
rebootstrap for already installed verifiers.

Loss of recovery custody requires out-of-band recovery-root replacement.
Workstation compromise can also expose local recovery custody; assess it as a
possible root compromise. Updated revocations protect verifiers only after
they receive authenticated new trust. A permanently disconnected verifier
cannot learn that an old release was revoked.

The provenance is a signed first-party statement from the build workflow. It
binds source, producer and artifact hashes, but is not an independently isolated
builder, reproducible-build proof or a certified SLSA level. See the
[design decision](../adr/stable-workflow-signing.md) and
[primary-source comparison](../research/release-signing-ceremonies.md).
